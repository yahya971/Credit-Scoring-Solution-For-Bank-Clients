# Credit-Scoring-Solution-For-Bank-Clients
With credit scoring becoming one of the newest trends used by banks to represent the credit worthiness of an individual, I was tasked to Design and Implement a credit scoring solution for BIAT clients. The role of this mission is to calculate a client's score based on multivariate factors, and to display them in an ergonomic dashboard containing important metrics for data visualization.

During this project, I was successful in completing these tasks:
- Setting up a data warehouse for clients' data based by designing a star schema model: fact & dimensions tables. ( PostgreSQL, Talend).
- Collecting additional data about the clients by scrapping their LinkedIn profiles' public information (Jupyter Notebook, Selenium, BeautifulSoup).
- Creating a script for calculating a client's credit score (Jupyter Notebook).
- Data visualization and analysis by designing a dashboard using ELK stack (Elasticsearch, logstash, Kibana).
